`git` and `make` are required dependencies for building. `curl` and/or `wget` are recommended, and `jq` is useful for 
quickly looking up values in, for example `genesis.json`

These can all be installed via your package manager:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git curl wget make jq
```

or

```bash
sudo yum install git curl wget make jq
```
